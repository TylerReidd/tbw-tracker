An application built to track the progress of students who are on the spectrum and how they have progressed session after session.

There is a set of behavior components, where a therapist would input a new 'program.'
The student components would serve to define a student by name and age.
the progress components track the students progress in each behavior they are training.

Eventually ChartJS will be implemented to display progress over time visually.
